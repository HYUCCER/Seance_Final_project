<div class="bio">
      Séance (Angelo Yousef, Sean Kovacs, Parker Tozier, Clay Hollander, and Ben
      Sandall) initially formed to be one of those bands that doesn’t play any
      music, but they wear like, baseball jerseys, and do bits. But they decided
      to start playing emo music because emo music is very lucrative, and they
      plan to make hella money then get box seats at baseball games. They also
      enjoy Weezer music, swimming, and talking to their neighbors, Brandon, and
      Phil. Séance formed in 2020, and they plan to break up around 2025 or so.
      Oh, and stream them on Spotify, or whatever app you listen too music on!
