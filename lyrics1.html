      <div class="bio">
      Think it’s cooler when I didn’t pretend That I’m in love with diet trends
      <br />
      I’m sorry Regis but I’m phoning a friend I think I’ll ask the audience
      <br />
      I pass time take advantage of all your fears <br />
      Pioneer sewing sutures til the cut adheres <br />
      I pass time take advantage of all your fears <br />
      And I die on the side of the road <br />
      With the deer and he spoke in code <br />
      With all those lines he wrote <br />
      Stay still. Relapse. Implode. <br />
      Let’s spend money on the pills we like And never ever go outside <br />
      Speak in tongues and we’ll die on the car ride <br />
      Dry your skin and let your dreams die <br />
      My oh my oh my <br />
      Stay still, relapse and let your dreams die <br />
      You were cooler when you didn’t pretend You cherry pick your problem
      friends <br />
      I’m sorry honey but the package was sent <br />
      So you accuse the audience <br />
      I pass time drink a 120 beers <br />
      Colonizer with the siren blowin out my ears <br />
      Pass time drink 120 beers <br />
      You know I love it when you pick n choose I’m gonna take your life before
      those smokes do

      When you need me the most I can waste all your time <br />
      When you look like a ghost or when you fall out of line <br />
      When I'm haunting the coast I can tell you a lie <br />
      I watch you look at the lights and fall back on mine <br />
      Said you were a hard fought fight <br />
      The best in me was the worst you had in mind <br />
      Saying I'm the worst of my kind <br />
      You tell me to forget it they're mistakes you made online
